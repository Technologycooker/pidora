**Danger, Will Robinson!** Please note this is the README for a pre-release. You can view the [old README](https://github.com/jacroe/pidora/blob/48a886c8b786301cd4f8912cd0f3cc0616d4052b/README.md) and download the [lastest stable release](https://github.com/jacroe/pidora/releases/tag/v0.1.1).

Installation
------------

1.	Run the following command `wget https://raw.github.com/jacroe/pidora/master/install.sh && chmod +x install.sh && ./install.sh`.
2.	Follow the instructions [here](http://raspberrypi.stackexchange.com/questions/752/how-do-i-prevent-the-screen-from-going-blank) to make the monitor not turn itself off. However, save it to the `~/.xsessionrc` instead of `~/.xinitrc`.
3.	Finally, remove all the icons on the desktop and set the statusbar to hide automatically. This isn't necessary but it gives less an impression that this is a computer.

Updates
-------

Updates are easy thinks to Git. Simply `cd ~/pidora` and then `git pull`. If Pidora is currently running, you'll need to kill pianobar and restart the server. This can easily be done by simply restarting the Pi. Please note, updates may contain new bugs. Use at your own risk. If your installation does become unusuable, may I suggest our [releases](https://github.com/jacroe/pidora/releases)?
